# CIS399 Final Project

This is our final project for CIS399 system administration.  The program takes a list of users and keys and creates puppet modules for each user.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

You will need Python3.x and puppet to be installed.

### Installing

To install, drop the python script in the root directory of your puppet installation.  

## Running the program

The script takes a file of users and keys with each being on its own line.

```
username
key
username2
key2
```
To run simply execute:
```
python create_users.py user_file.txt
```
